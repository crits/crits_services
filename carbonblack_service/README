The Carbon Black service for CRITs

To configure, you'll need to enter the address of your
Carbon Black server and an API token to authenticate
to the server.

You will need to install the carbon black API.  You can
optionally install pympler.  The Carbon Black API can
return a lot of data, and the BSON limit is 16 MB,
installing this package will make sure that this limit
is not exceeded.

The service works on Samples, IPs, and Domains.
