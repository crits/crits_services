This CRITs service is utilizing the code from: https://github.com/blackthorne/Codetective (you'll have to obtain a copy and put it in the service's directory so that codetective.py and __init__.py are present in /data/crits_services/codetective_service/Codetective/ folder)

Codetective
Sometimes we ran into hashes and other codes and can't figure out where did they came from and how they were built. If you work on pen-testing that might easily happen when you are testing systems from a black box perspective and you are able to grab a password file with hashed contents maybe from an exposed backup file or by dumping memory.. This may also be useful as a part of a fingerprinting process.


Installation instructions:
Copy over codetective.py and __init__.py into /data/crits_services/codetective_service/Codetective/ folder
Just make sure that you have the imported libs present.
Done!
