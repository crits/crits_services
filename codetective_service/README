Sometimes we ran into hashes and other codes and can't figure out where did they came from and how they were built. If you work on pen-testing that might easily happen when you are testing systems from a black box perspective and you are able to grab a password file with hashed contents maybe from an exposed backup file or by dumping memory.. This may also be useful as a part of a fingerprinting process.
