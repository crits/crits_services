This is a service intended to perform sample analyses using Cuckoo
in a distributed manner.

This is not a standalone service! You'll find everything you need
to use and setup this service here:

https://github.com/cynexit/cuckoo_distributed


In this directory itself you can only find all the necessary CRITs
service files.
